## 📖 Project Overview

**SplitWise-Backend** is the server-side implementation for an expense-sharing platform. The application allows users to:
- Manage expenses within groups.
- Track outstanding balances between individuals.
- Simplify the process of settling debts.

This backend service handles the core functionality of the system, including data persistence, business logic, and exposing APIs for client-side interaction.

## 🚀 Features

- Create and manage users and groups
- Add shared expenses within a group
- Support for multiple split types:
  - Equal Split
  - Exact Amount Split
  - Percentage Split
- Accurate net balance calculation per user
- Optimized settlement logic to minimize transactions
- Settlement payment tracking with status and payment method
- Group-wise and user-wise expense summaries
- Email notifications for settlements and reminders
- RESTful APIs built using Spring Boot
- MySQL database for persistent storage

---

## ⚙️ How the Application Works

- Users and groups are created.
- Expenses are added with details such as amount, payer, group ID, and split type.
- Based on the split type (Equal, Exact, or Percentage), individual shares are calculated.
- All expenses are processed together to compute a net balance for each user.

Users with:
- Negative balance → Debtors
- Positive balance → Creditors

- The system generates simplified settlements by matching debtors with creditors to minimize transactions.
- Settlement records are stored with payment method, status, and timestamps.
- Users receive email notifications when settlements are created or updated.

---

## 🔄 Supported Split Types

### 🔹 Equal Split
The total expense amount is divided equally among all users involved.

### 🔹 Exact Split
Each user pays a fixed amount specified at the time of expense creation.

### 🔹 Percentage Split
Each user pays a defined percentage of the total expense amount.

---

## 🧮 Settlement Logic

- Net balances are calculated for all users
- Debtors are matched with creditors
- Transactions are minimized
- Settlement status and payment method are tracked

This fulfills the “Settle Dues” requirement of a real-world expense sharing system.

---

## 📬 Email Notifications

Email notifications are sent when:
- A settlement is generated
- A user needs to pay another user

Implemented using:
- JavaMailSender
- Spring `@Service`
- Constructor-based dependency injection

---

## 🎯 Key Design Highlights

- Layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
- DTOs used to separate API models from entities
- Enums used for controlled values (PaymentMethod)
- Constructor injection for clean and testable code
- Timestamp-based tracking for settlements
- Interview-ready, real-world backend design
